		"prologue.content": "We've called Lighthaven a 'campus', but how much does it feel like a true college experience in full swing? A bright spark of an event here or there, and then everyone disperses — or a monolithic event organized by one group, with its walls impermeable to passing visitors...",
		"apps.content": "Imagine instead a week full of campus life, in all its richness: six-to-ten members of the community organizing \"branches\" — two-to-five-day workshops on <a href='https://gobeyondgoals.com/'>goal factoring</a>, meditation, <a href='https://school.vibe.camp/'>social skills</a>, <a href='https://trading.camp/'>quantitative trading</a>, chocolate-tasting mastery, or jazz ukulele, with \"students\" mingling over lunch, dinner, and nightly fire pit hangouts to swap stories of their days in class.",
		"uiux.content": "Of course, like any good college experience, there are also scattered teams of two or three there to launch a new project from their \"dorm room\", or solo floaters just there to vibe, but when you add it all up it just feels like Lighthaven is blooming with life, like a desert after rainfall. This isn't the aimless, temporary revelry of Burning Man; this is what happens when *our* community comes together for a week away from the world to learn things about the world, each other, and ourselves...", 
		"seo.content": "Summer Camp is a little of college and a little of Disneyland. The community comes together to learn and teach.",
		"advertising.content": "Independent teachers, who otherwise run their own workshops and events in scattered places and times through the year, have brought their programs, large and small, to run in classrooms and dance halls across Lighthaven’s campus for five days of learning, discussion, and of course, overwhelming FOMO. Emerging event-runners trialing two-day experiments for a half-dozen students run in some pockets of the campus, while Arbor’s (in)famous Quant Trading Bootcamp takes over other buildings — but students from all the various streams gather together for shared meals and after-dark gatherings, braiding the separate threads into one, um, braid.",

		"faqs.question1": "Can I bring my workshop/talk/thing here?",
		"faqs.answer1":
			"Yes! We have two frameworks for this: branches are 3-4 day structured events, like a workshop or a bootcamp. If you are interested in running a branch, please contact ross@trading.camp. Outside of branches, if you want to give a talk or run a shorter activity, mealtimes and evenings are avaliable for that. Learn more <a href='branches/'>here</a>.",
		"faqs.question2": "Is this included in my LessOnline/Manifest ticket? Does buying a ticket to this get me into the other ones?",
		"faqs.answer2":
			"No. You need individual tickets for each of LessOnline, Summer Camp, and Manifest.",
		"faqs.question3": "Is housing provided?",
		"faqs.answer3":
			"A limited number of onsite rooms can be purchased from Lighthaven, but there will be many times more summer campers than rooms, so most people will have to find other housing.",
		"faqs.question4": "Is food provided?",
		"faqs.answer4":
			"Yes. There will be meals and snacks.",
		"faqs.question5": "Can I drop in and out of branches?",
		"faqs.answer5":
			"It's up to branch leaders whether they let people sit in on sessions, but for the most part, no. Joining a branch involves some commitment.",
		"faqs.question6": "Will I enjoy/benefit from this?",
		"faqs.answer6":
			"If you're excited about LessOnline, Manifest, Trading Camp, ACX, or the general community around Lighthaven, it will probably be a blast.",
