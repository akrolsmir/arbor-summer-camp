There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc."

You might be coming in with an idea of what it means to think like an engineer, a founder, or a lawyer. Trader mindset is another way to see the world.

We believe that the best was to learn to trade is to trade. Most days center around live trading in teams with fake money on our internal exchange.

Trading Bootcamp answers three core questions:
- What is quant trading?
- Do I like it?
- Am I any good at it?

Most of our students have no experience in trading going in, but do have a little background in programming and math.
